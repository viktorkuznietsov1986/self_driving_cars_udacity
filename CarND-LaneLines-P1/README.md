# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

In this project the simple lane lines detection has been implemented using Python and OpenCV. The lane line detection is applied to an image as well as the video stream (it's split up to frames, which are actually images).
The project is split into 2 files:
1. P1.ipynb - the jupyter notebook which contains all the implementations.
2. writeup.md - the writeup based on the implementation done in the notebook.
